  <h1>Hallo!</h1>
  Hier kann man Infos hinterlegen wenn man will!


  <p style="text-align:center;white-space: pre-line;">
    Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
    A tale of a fateful trip
    That started from this tropic port
    Aboard this tiny ship.

    The mate was a mighty sailing man,
    The skipper brave and sure.
    Five passengers set sail that day
    For a three hour tour, a three hour tour.

    The weather started getting rough,
    The tiny ship was tossed,
    If not for the courage of the fearless crew
    The Minnow would be lost, the Minnow would be lost.

    The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle
    With Gilligan
    The Skipper too,
    A millionaire and his wife,
    A movie star
    The Professor and Mary Ann,*
    Here on Gilligan's Isle.

    So this is the tale of our castaways,
    They're here for a long, long time,
    They'll have to make the best of things,
    It's an uphill climb.

    The first mate and his Skipper too,
    Will do their very best,
    To make the others comfortable,
    In their tropic island nest.

    No phone, no lights, no motor car,
    Not a single luxury,
    Like Robinson Crusoe,
    It's primitive as can be.

    So join us here each week my friend,
    You're sure to get a smile,
    From seven stranded castaways,
    Here on "Gilligan's Isle."

    (*In the original version it's "and the rest".
    The Professor and Mary Ann were not named)
